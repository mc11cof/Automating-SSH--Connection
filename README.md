# Automating-SSH-Connection
Automating a SSH connection with Python

This python script was made with the Paramiko library which is used to connect via SSH with python.

I used the script to connect to my Linux-Ubuntu virtual machine. I then sent a command to the host termial and printed out the output of the command.

It is really important to always close the SSH connections once all the tasks are completed.

Here is Paramiko's docmumentation : https://docs.paramiko.org/en/stable/
